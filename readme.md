# LangChain Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my step-by-step learning of LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). The goal is to explore LangChainâ€™s core concepts, build small projects along the way, and ultimately develop a full-fledged application using LangChain.

## - ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find Here

### - Fundamental Concepts:

- Models, Prompts, and Parsers
- Memory for LLMs
- Chains for processing input/output
- Question Answering with LangChain
- Agents for reasoning and decision-making
- Integration with vector stores and embeddings
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques

### - Hands-On Notebooks:

-Step-by-step explanations and practical code examples

### - Final Project:

-A real-world application leveraging LangChain
